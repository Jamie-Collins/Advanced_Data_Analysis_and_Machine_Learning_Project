# Advanced_Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning_Project

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development using a dataset of customer transactions.  

## Objectives  
- Perform in-depth data cleaning and feature engineering.  
- Visualize trends and relationships in the data.  
- Build predictive models to classify customers as likely or unlikely to churn.  

## Tools and Libraries Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  

## Key Highlights  
1. Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.  
2. Conducted EDA to uncover insights about customer behavior.  
3. Applied advanced feature engineering techniques.  
4. Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models.  

Below is the full Python code for this project.
